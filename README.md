# Travelers-Sonic-Pi

Travelers, from *Outer Wilds*, in Sonic PI!

Each Traveler has a phase-shifted volume cycle, so each fades in and out.
Hopefully this is similar to using the singalscope as planets move around the solar system.

Requires Sonic PI to run which can be found at: [https://sonic-pi.net/](https://sonic-pi.net/).

Run `run_travelers.rb` because the `travelers.rb` is too big to fit into the buffer.

## Contributions.

I don't yet have one stem that the DLC added.
If you'd like to add it a PR is welcome!

Additionally, my instrument and sample choices might leave something to be desired. Suggestions also welcome.

The Harmonica method is a little rough also.
If you want to rework that I'd gladly take a PR.
